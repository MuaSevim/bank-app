# Banxy App

A modern, minimalistic bank app created with Vanilla JavaScript and Plain CSS

## Functionality

- It is not as functional as real world bank applications since I made this using only Vanilla JavaScript to practice my skills.
- It has essential functionalities such as transfering money, requesting loan, deleting account ...
- Datas are displayed beautifully with power of modern array methods and some magical CSS
- This project is still in development and there is a lot more to come
